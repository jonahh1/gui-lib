# A GUI Library built on [Raylib](https://raylib.com)
## Goal:
My goal for this project is to be able to make a web-like gui system but without the need for html, css & javascript. Instead I want to control lyaout, styling & logic through my own language inspired by css or json.

## Current Features:
- the ability to draw rects and text
- constant variables
- importing other styles
